- Hello, we are LeanERA! 🏙
- We are a company, based in Leipzig, Germany and Berlin, Germany! 🌍
- We help to scale and digitalize your business. 🏆
- Our loyalty system is build with Java, using Spring, Hibernate and Querydsl. ☕
- The Backend team is currently writing Serverless Functions in the Google Cloud using TypeScript and NestJS. ✨
- Our Frontend Developers use Vue 3, Vite, Nuxt 3, Tailwind CSS and Pinia.
What's really handy is that both our frontend and backend teams work with TypeScript. This also allows the teams to work cross-functionally and there is no need for ‘translation’! ✨
- We are managing our IT infrastructure using Infrastructure as a Code (IaC) with Terraform for AWS and Google Cloud. So we don't have to worry about manually setting up servers, but we do have a high-performance and scalable infrastructure at low cost. This gives us more time for what we really like to do: building awesome applications. 🚀
